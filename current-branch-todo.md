## To do

#### Things to do in the current branch before it is merged to master

- [ ] Add UBO support to the "FBO shader" (which should be renamed).
- [ ] Make it so either the image is rendered to an off screen buffer, or (probably the better idea) make it so that there are multiple command buffers to correspond to the multiple framebuffers.
